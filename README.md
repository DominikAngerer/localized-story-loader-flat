## What is localized-story-loader-flat
If you're using a folder structure like:
```
- de
--- home
--- locations
----- First Location
----- Second Location
```
you can now directly use this plugin to access all (for example) *locations* in a dropdown. If you're looking for a *not localized* version (so we wouldn't look for `de` or `en` as root folders - look for the `story-loader-flat`.
